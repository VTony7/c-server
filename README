This program is written in C and deployed in the docker image.
That gets an argument as (an) arbitray file or directory name(s) and calls system() with "ls " + the argument.

$ docker run -it --rm c_server /

This has the typically command injection vulnerability (and so on).

$ docker run -it --rm c_server "/ ; cat /etc/passwd"
